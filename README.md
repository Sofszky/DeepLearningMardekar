# DeepLearningMardekar

Our chosen topic was to create a Pokerbot using Reinforcement Learning.
To get our basic data, we've used this poker game code from Github:
https://github.com/omarshammas/pyPoker-Texas-HoldEm
We've modified it, so it can be applied for Reinforcement Learning by adding the betting phase.
We are planning to distribute the reward according to the money earned by a player.
